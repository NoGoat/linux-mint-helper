# linux-mint-helper
A small helper program for Linux Mint meant to ease users into using the terminal.

The goal of this project is to ease users into using the terminal by doing simple tasks like installing an app, or updating the system.

Right now, the program is so small it should work with Ubuntu and Pop!\_OS without any issues.

Also, the code in the main page tends to be incomplete so use the code from the [releases](https://github.com/TheNoGoat/linux-mint-helper/releases) page if you want to work with something kinda stable
